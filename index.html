        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>My name is Ivan Saucedo. I'm 29 years old. Originally from El Paso, Texas, I currently live in Austin. I was first exposed to programming in high school - I picked up basic HTML, Python, and Java - all culminating in a project I turned in for one of my classes. Unfortunately, I left it all on the back burner as I chased other creative outlets, namely music and writing. A few years ago I caught a video on YouTube of a 12-year old giving a presentation of an iOS app he had programmed. This rekindled my interest and I began trying to learn on my own. I enrolled in edX's Intro to Computer Science at MIT, as well as several web development courses on Udemy, Udacity, and Codeacademy. Of course, I also followed programming channels on online message boards and most recently I was reading Eloquent Javascript. </p>
        <p>I was exposed to a lot and I learned a lot, but unfortunately I was missing a sense of structure and teamwork. I wanted to take my programming career to the next step. In November of 2017, I stumbled on the UT Coding Bootcamp and, after researching the program and consulting with friends who are in the industry, I decided to take the plunge. One of my friends works in web development and I look up to him. I admire what he's doing and I want to do the same for others. I want to set a good example for my niece and nephews. I'm excited to be here. I'm excited to be learning from talented individuals. And most importantly, I'm excited about meeting like-minded people and learning from them, as well as - hopefully - having the opportunity to teach them as well. </p>
